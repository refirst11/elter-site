# Intention

## DRY principle
Defining scoped styles typically involves writing one-to-one, which doesn't adhere to the DRY principle.  
If you create multiple shareable styles, the className notation becomes a combination of more than one.

If you want to share encapsulated styles, extract them as export constants for reuse.  
The best practice is to apply a single style to a single class name only once as possible.

Of course, we also provide APIs for complex use cases where you want to apply multiple conditional styles.

## Why for What
The design philosophy of elter was as follows.
1. Lightweight
2. Easy to use and not many APIs
3. Inherits the feel of writing CSS

And it was made for the following framework.  
- React
- Next.js
- Remix
- Vue.js 
- Svelte
- others...

We recommend using a React derivative that can handle tsx.  
But Vue.js and Svelte etc. handle it by cutting it into a separate file as ts.

## Involved only development
We recommend including this library in your devDependencies.
The reason is that it only provides type definitions, a development runtime, and a pure type compiler.
The pure definition is not zero runtime, but no runtime, as it guarantees that it does nothing in production.


## Why Objects
Why didn't elter use template literals?
It's because the keys of objects being unique and singular had an affinity with the concept of CSS conflicts.
Of course, there's compatibility with TypeScript for auto-completion and automatic error detection,
but the primary reason we chose it was the existence of object keys.

## Thoughts on CSS-in-JS    
CSS libraries and frameworks can be likened to the clothes people wear.
Yes, it's assumed from the start that they will be tried, switched, discarded, and replaced.
Just as people change the clothes they wear every day, the libraries used for each project are also different.

We encourage you to try out different libraries if possible, as the knowledge you gain from one CSS-in-JS solution can be reused in other CSS-in-JS solutions.

## Why it was made
Just on October 26, 2022, next.js13 was announced.  
I read the next documentation many times and realized that front-end developers need to be aware of the client-server boundary and build Next.js, I also realized that all the existing CSS in JS solutions that work client-side don't work server-side.

At that point, if you want to do styling in SC, you have to use CSS, use Tailwind CSS, use linaria or vanilla extract. In either case, using regular CSS was the easiest and best way to style server components.

As you can probably guess by now, I wanted a lightweight library that could style server components. (Ideally, it should be able to be written directly within the component or be separated freely)

elter is by no means a groundbreaking library like tailwindcss, and it does not have outstanding mechanics like the atomic approach of stylex, but I think it is a library like emotion and styled jsx that you will notice its robustness and simplicity as you use it.
