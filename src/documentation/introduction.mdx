# Introduction to TypedCSSX
It's a CSS in JS library with a simple syntax.  
It works with most js frameworks and also works with a single ts file.  

Its characteristic feature is the powerful typed that enables autocomplete during development.  
Supported traditional CSS notation such as Media Query and pseudo-elements, Provides solutions for large-scale applications that are easy to maintain.  


## Zero Runtime
It is exported as static CSS at compile process.  
Since it is embedded in the directly build process, It can cached the browser and CDN.


## RSC
You can preview using the "use client", and you can also preview the \`Server Component\`  
by using the PreviewServerCSS Component.

## Type safe
The property is typed. And detects syntax errors.  
Static type checking is performed at compile time, so the CSS generated after compilation is reliable.

## Dry principle
Defining scoped styles typically involves writing one-to-one, which doesn't adhere to the DRY principle.
If you create multiple shareable styles, the className notation becomes a combination of more than one.

If you want to share encapsulated styles, extract them as export constants for reuse.
The best practice is to apply a single style to a single class name only once.

Of course, we also provide APIs for complex use cases where you want to apply multiple conditional styles.

## How to use
Write a cssx method and write the style to the object.  
The method just returns a string, so just apply it to the class name.  

Styles can be written outside of a component.


<Tabs items={['tsx', 'css']}>
  <Tab>
```tsx title="Component.tsx"
import cssx from 'typedcssx';

export const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div className={css.blue}>
      BlueText
    </div>
  )
};

const css = cssx.create({
  blue: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'blue'
  },
});
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```css
.blue_f8ah90 {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: blue;
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Inspirations
Although this library is a fairly latecomer to the CSS in JS world, it is heavily by these and other earlier libraries.

- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/):** **StyleSheet Class** is impeccable. It's standard in TypedCSSX is inspired by React Native.
- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/):** **Scoped CSS** in Vue.js excels in simplicity and directness.
- **[Styled-JSX](https://styled-system.com/):** Very stable CSS in JS, template literals were easy to write with **VSC's autocompletion**.
- **[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction/):** I found writing **template literals easy**. This was the standard CSS in JS in React.
- **[Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/):** It is inspired by vanilla extract's concept of **object, property types**.
- **[Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria):**  TypedCSSX was also inspired by the concept of **static CSS extraction**.

There integrated the standout features from each of these libraries into TypedCSSX. This is our expression of gratitude to these exceptional open-source projects and our contribution to the community.
