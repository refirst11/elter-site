# Practices

## TypedX(TypedCSSX)
This name is certainly stiff, long, and difficult to remember.
However, we initially decided on it because we thought it was the best name that clearly expressed the technical content.
If we had to call it something, we think it would be easier to remember if we abbreviated it to TypedX.

## Q&A
### Compile error
TypedX uses fs to build css, so it cannot parse imports such as .css and .svg and other image file extention. To deal with this issue, load images via src="".  
Do not use simultaneously on css and tsx (separate into ts files, or delete the css import)  

TypedX only compiles ts or tsx files.  
This is to minimize build tim   es.

### Since when has the project been progressing?
It started around October 2023, initially with react animation hooks.

### Is TypedX easy to use?
It's a pain to put a comma at the end of an object, but thanks to the React Property type, value completion works for the most part, so I think it's easy to use as a CSS in JS.
