# Practices


## Q&A
### Compile error
elter uses fs to build css, so it cannot parse imports such as .css and .svg and other image file extention. To deal with this issue, load images via src="".  
Do not use simultaneously on css and tsx (separate into ts files, or delete the css import)  

elter only compiles ts or tsx files.  
This is to minimize build tim   es.

### Since when has the project been progressing?
It started around October 2023, initially with react animation hooks.
